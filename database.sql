'For a straight run through without having to cross the street, the path is about 1 mile (or a little less) from the pinned parking up to Upper Afton Road. If you cross Upper Afton, the path does continue but you have to cross the road.',
'Definitely debris in spots, a couple HUGE patches of sand, some pavement cracks, not the smoothest. You have to go over multiple bridges that have huge ridges on each side but manageable if youâ€™re going fast enough.',
'Pretty difficult- this is essentially one gradual hill with lots of dips, turns, and bumps. We call it Suicide hill because you will not lose speed once starting from the top and you have to maneuver sharp turns. The bridges also cause some difficulty because you are racing down an incline then hit the sharp incline of the bridge.',
'It opens half hour before sunrise until a half hour after sunset so early or late like that is usually the best time to go for fewer people. The parking lot is only open seasonally so it can get pretty busy especially in the middle of summer.',
'If pinned parking lot is closed, you can park on the street at Upper Afton Rd and go either direction on the path.',
